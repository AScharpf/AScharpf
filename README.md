Welcome to my Github Page!

This github profile is a collection of my most recent projects and collaborations.

As of September 2022 I have decided to become serious about starting a career in software development and if you stroll around this profile you will get some insight into the different projects I have been working on and some technologies that I have been exploring.

My preferred tech-stack is:

React

Express

Mongo DB & Mongoose

Node.js

Jest 

My favourite aspect of coding are the constantly new emerging technologies and with that a steady stream of opportunities to broaden my tech-horizon and learn new things. Programming to me is an enduring puzzle that wants to be solved and I love coming up with new & inventive ways of solving different problems.
